# VrScript
Announced in 2015, John Carmack has been working on a Racket / Scheme based language for developing on the Gear VR called VrScript. Carmack demoed VrScript at Oculus Connect 2 in September 2015, and while it isn't widely available to develop with it, some samples can be found from discussion list archives.

Thank you to GitHub user [jfonte](https://github.com/jfonte) for the archive/video link and issue request!
