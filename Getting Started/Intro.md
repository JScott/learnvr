# Getting Started
So you want to be a virtual or augmented reality developer? Welcome to the Matrix, ladies & gentlemen! 

## The VR/AR Ecosystem - An Overview
The virtual and augmented reality ecosystem is rapidly changing and evolving, so take this section with a grain of salt and expect updates often. [NYU's Media Lab](http://www.nycmedialab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.14.VR_.pdf?utm_content=buffereefce&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) created an excellent state of the industry document that I highly recommend checking out.

[This document](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~fuchs/publications/DisplaysforAR99.pdf) (PDF) from UNC highlights the different methods for augmented displays, and is a good primer on the history of AR HMDs and the differences in how augmented reality can be accomplished. 

As you start exploring your own ways of getting more involved with virtual reality development, ask yourself [these six questions](https://livierickson.com/blog/6-questions-to-ask-before-diving-into-vr-development/) and think about where you want to focus your learning efforts. This will help you plan out a way to start creating virtual and augmented reality and give you some insight into the options that are available for getting on the right path. 

## I want to build for immersive tech, where do I start?
I get this question a lot at events and conferences, and the answer will depend on your interests, previous experience, and platform of choice. The entire repository is designed to be self-driven, but I'm going to define a few personas that will help you figure out where to get started and give a sample plan of study. Throughout the respository, you'll find notes for each persona to help get you the right information for your background:

**Y.T** : You have some experience trying out a VR device or two, and are fascinated with the technology. At this point, you'd identify as a casual user and you're just deciding to get into development. You are comfortable with a computer, but this is your first foray into building your own application. 

**Art3mis**: You'd call yourself a VR enthusiast, and you've got some familiarity with the different devices and platforms. You've thought about developing for VR before, and have some coding experience, though you're not sure exactly how it will translate to virtual or augmented reality development. 

**Trinity**: You're all in with virtual and augmented reality, but are coming to it from a different perspective and you're ready to learn how to code for Reality++. Maybe you've done some writing for a video game, explored user experience design, or worked on animation and 3D modeling. The industry isn't new to you, but developing is, and you're excited to start programming!

**Lady 3Jane**: You've tried every prototype device out there and frequent events and meetups with AR/VR technology. You've got a developer background in C++, C#, or JavaScript and you're ready to take those experiences and bring your ideas to life. You might have already downloaded one of the tools for Reality++ development, but aren't quite sure how to get started with them. 

**The Oracle**: You're already a Reality++ developer, and you're ready to share your wisdom with the world! You might have a few specific topics that you're interested in learning more about, or having trouble with, or maybe you want to look at a few other ways of building for AR/VR and try something new out. You're even considering submitting a pull request to add some of your own content to the LearnVR project! 

## Using this repository
The first thing that you're going to want to do when building a study plan is get familiar with the device ecosystem for Reality++ and the different options for developing. 

1. Familiarize yourself with the basics of virtual and augmented reality devices and the options you have for building applications with [this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/misslivirose/Beginning-VR-Development) and the [overview slides](http://livi.link/svcc2015). When you have a project in mind, think about the following to guide your study plan:

 * What is the initial platform (desktop / mobile / game console) that I want to build for? 

 * What type of experience do I want to build?

 * How much do I know about the tools I want to use?

2. Choose a toolset that seems appealing to you and to the types of applications you're interested in building:

 * If you're interested in building a game, cinematic experience, or an application that relies on heavy environment effects, [Unity](http://unity3d.com) or [Unreal](http://unrealengine.com), two of the most popular game engines, are good starting points. 
		
 * If you're more interested in applications that present existing data and utilizing a fair amount of web content, consider looking into [WebVR](http://webvr.info) , [AFrame](http://aframe.io) or [Vizor Create](http://vizor.io). 
 
 * If you're interested in creating 360 degree video content, brush up on what [Jaunt VR](http://jauntvr.com) and [Next VR](http://nextvr.com) are working on. Then, head over to PremiumBeat's [blog](http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/how-to-shoot-edit-and-upload-360-degree-videos/) to see how to get started. 
		
3. Find the corresponding sections in the repository for the toolset you're interested in and read over the introduction. This will break down each level into more detailed sections and help guide you through the relevant content for your experience & background.
