# Building VR in Unity
Unity is one of the leading game engines in the industry and is fast becoming a popular tool for virtual and augmented reality developers with a wide range of support for different platforms and devices. 

## Y.T: Learning Unity Basics
The first time I opened Unity 3D, I promptly closed it, overwhelmed by the editor, tabs, and vast amount of visual information that I was presented with initially. I then reopened it, and set to work getting started with my first app: a color changing sphere floating in front of me. 

Hello, Unity.

Unity has an amazing developer community, with a ton of resources available for aspiring Unity developers to learn from. As you start working on your own projects, I highly recommend referring back to them depending on which areas you find you're having trouble with. 

## Art3mis: Introduction to Unity Projects (Tutorial)
Once you have an overview of what Unity is and have decided to dive a little bit deeper into learning, I always find that the best way to accelerate the learning process is to just dive in and start a project. I know for me, this was a little challenging and intimidating, which is why I documented my first-ever full project, a simple timed maze game, with a full Unity tutorial including the code for all of the scripts. 

[You can work through this Unity Tutorial at your own pace](http://livi.link/learnunity), and it covers both the project steps as well as an overview of the editor and how to get started with building in 3D. 

## Trinity: Using Unity for Virtual & Augmented Reality
After becoming familiar with the Unity editor and working on a project of your own, you can start to integrate virtual and augmented reality SDKs and plugins into your project to start bringing your experiences to different devices. In a production environment, you'll probably want to design your application for Reality++ from the get-go, but when you're just getting started, it can be helpful to start looking at how to add support for difference device types. 

When I started to feel comfortable building out the basics of Unity apps, I decided that first person shooters just weren't for me, and created [KittenVR](http://kittenvr.com) to document my progress with building the game. 

I also spent some time working with Meta, an augmented reality device, at a hackathon this past spring, and documented the process for that project with two blog posts:

## Lady 3Jane: Optimization & Specified Targets
One of the most important components of a good VR application is making sure that your application has excellent performance - you'll want to aim for hitting a framerate of at least 75 FPS, and ideally hit 90-120. 

## The Oracle: Community Engagement
Even becoming deeply familiar with Unity, and once you've had a few projects under your belt, you'll likely run into issues that can be challenging to troubleshoot - especially if you're like me and spend way too much time staring at the same line of code, only to realize the bug is somewhere else entirely. At this stage, you're probably more likely to find help (and contribute!) within the community, so here are some of my favorite places to find assistance and help others:
