If you have experience with web development, you may be curious about how your existing knowledge can be applied to the virtual reality industry - and the great news is, you can get started today building beautiful VR applications that run directly in the browser. Applications built for the virtual reality web are able to adapt between VR and non-VR modes, and to a variety of different devices.
