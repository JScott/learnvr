### So you want to build for virtual & augmented reality?
Congratulations! You've come to the right place. Whether you're just starting out as a developer or have been building for some time, this site / repository will help you get started. 

### Getting Started
In this repository, content is saved by topic. Some topics include sample code and projects you can work through, others are tutorials, and some are collections of slide decks, documents, links - pretty much any content that I've created to help teach VR development in smaller workshops will be made available through this repository to follow along with or play with at your own pace.

Where to go first: Getting Started / Intro! 

### My story
In 2013, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Virginia Tech (go Hokies!) and started working full time as a Program Manager with the Remote Desktop team at Microsoft in Silicon Valley. Although I liked the work and the team, I found myself envious of the passion and drive that I saw surrounding me. I knew that I wanted to get back into developing regularly, but nothing really captured that excitement for me. 

One day, I stumbled across [VirtuAlly](http://youtube.com/pixelwhipt) and had what I call a "literal lightbulb moment" - the entire room got brighter, and I knew that I had found what I wanted to spend my life working on in virtual reality. I dove head first into absorbing everything I could find about building for VR, got my hands on as many developer kits as I could afford, and never looked back.

One of the most common questions that I get is how to get into the VR / AR industry, especially from people who are curious about developing but may not have had experience in 3D graphics or game programming. My goal with this project is to provide a central resource 

### Who is the LearnVR project for?
Anyone with an interest in joining and contributing to the virtual and augmented reality industry! 

### I build for VR/AR/MR - can I help contribute?
YES! One person's experiences and resources isn't teaching - building this industry and ecosystem will be better when we're collaborating together.
