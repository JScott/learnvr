#Designing for Virtual Reality
Immersive technologies bring computing technology into three dimensions, requiring us to rethink how we build experiences and expect users to interact with our applications. Great VR design begins right at the beginning of the development process, and applications should be designed with the platform, user, and input in mind at every stage of the process.
