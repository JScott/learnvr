##Overview##
Audio that is oriented to a specific location within 3D space is referred to as *spatial sound*. It is a key component in creating immersive experiences in adding to ambiance and capturing attention, as we have evolved to quickly locate the origin of audio in our environments. 

Because performance in virtual reality applications is crutial for a great experience, it's important to make sure that audio files are optimized - especially true if you're creating a mobile VR application.

Sky Nite wrote a really great [guide on optimizing audio for VR in Unity](https://medium.com/@skynite/optimizing-audio-for-vr-in-unity-17a43cce25f2) that I recommend as a primer regardless of your chosen developer stack.
